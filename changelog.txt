------------

To Upgrade:
On your development workstation you must install the latest n98-magerun.
On all deployment servers update the scripts in usr/local/bin.

Removed environment specific deploy and backup targets in favor of generic backup and deploy targets which prompt for the environment.
You can now configure what environments you have by setting deploy.environments.
Backup now prompts you to back up the database, media, or both.
Backup now echo's the size of the backup.
New restore_backup target does a completely automated restore of the database and media to your local development environment.
Installing the backup script no longer requires you to edit the script to set database credentials.
flush_cache now uses n98-magerun, so it works with all cache backends.
After deploying the cache storage is flushed (again with n98-magerun)
Deploying now keeps only 10 previous deploys.

Bugs Fixed:
Sometimes git's autocrlf feature could cause switching branches to fail during package.
Backup was broken with password authentication.
It was not possible to overwrite files in subdirectories of /js with relink.
Patch files included in libs were not being applied during rebuild.
